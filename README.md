# DreamEyes: AI-Powered Narration for the Visually Impaired

## Overview

DreamEyes is an innovative AI project addressing the challenges faced by the visually impaired community. As of 2021, there are approximately 36 million visually impaired individuals worldwide, impacting their daily tasks and social interactions. DreamEyes leverages deep learning to generate narrative descriptions of the surrounding environment, enhancing the interaction and experience of visually impaired individuals.

## Key Features

- **Real-World Translation:** DreamEyes translates real-world data into rich and understandable paragraphs, converting them into audio format using advanced deep learning models.
  
- **Wearable Technology:** The project features a "smart" cap equipped with IoT components, including microprocessors that analyze real-world data and provide users with valuable information about their surroundings.

- **Deep Learning Algorithms:** Inspired by the learning mechanism of the human brain, DreamEyes employs deep learning algorithms. These algorithms, a subset of machine learning, enable the device to learn and make decisions from complex and large datasets.
